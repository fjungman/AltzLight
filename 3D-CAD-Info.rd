The files to make the LED strip holders are included, both in .123dx and .stl format.  
The upper and lower ones are made with a low-volume honycomb fill.  This is more than strong enough and doesn't use much filiment.
The middle holder is 80% fill so the screws have material to grab for the speaker mounts.  The holes can be changed as needed.
I used the square hole for a button I had lying around, so there is a lot of opportunity to improve here.  I was in a big hurry.
The system is designed to use 1.5" PVC or ABS sewer pipe.  I used the black ABS stuff from Home Depot.  It is a friction fit, no glue needed.
The base of mine used 2" for the legs and an interesting (2 in. x 1-1/2 in. x 1-1/2 in. ABS DWV All-Hub Double Fixture Sanitary Tee)
with a bushing (reducer) to tie the legs to the 1.5" pipe coming down.
The OD (outside diameter) of the 1.5" pipe is 1.9", which is what the holes are.
